# OPERANDA - Current State

Core TUI for Dyalog APL is functional: session, editors, tracer with stepping/breakpoints, variables pane, command palette, APL symbol input.

Recent work: fixed keyboard input in editor panes (space key and backtick/APL symbols now route correctly to focused editor).

See FACIENDA.md for what's next.
