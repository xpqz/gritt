# FACIENDA - Things to be done

## Priority: Pane Interactivity
- [ ] Mouse drag edges to resize (partially broken)
- [ ] Multiple interactive panes: all N panes should be interactive, not just focused one
- [ ] Singleton panes (stack, debug, etc.) should persist position/size after dismiss/recreate
- [ ] Tab should cycle focus back to session (not just between panes)


## Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] Attempts to use tmux send-keys to test backticks for eg comments failed

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Protocol audit: evaluate all unsupported RIDE messages, prioritize by importance
- [ ] Clipboard support (Ctrl+C copy, Ctrl+V paste)

## Phase 3: Editors - DONE
- [x] Handle OpenWindow/UpdateWindow messages
- [x] Editor pane (floating, using pane system)
- [x] Text editing for functions/operators
- [x] SaveChanges message
- [x] CloseWindow handling
- [x] Tracer window support (debugger:1, SetHighlightLine, WindowTypeChanged)

## Phase 4: Tracer (mostly complete)
- [x] Stack trace pane (C-] s toggle, click to switch frames)
- [x] Single tracer pane (not multiple overlapping windows like JS RIDE)
- [x] Escape pops stack frame
- [x] Step into/over/out commands (i, Enter/n, o keys)
- [x] Continue, resume all (c, r keys)
- [x] Trace backward/forward (p, f keys)
- [x] Breakpoints (C-] b toggle, visual indicator, immediate effect)
- [x] Edit mode in tracer (e to edit, Esc to return to tracing)
- [x] Clear stuck state command (close-all-windows via command palette)
- [x] Automatic window restoration (GetWindowLayout on connect)
- [x] Variables pane (C-] l toggle, ~ for [local]/[all] mode, Enter to edit, • marks locals)
- [ ] Test: popping stack frame in tracer should update variables pane
- [ ] Test: large values in variables pane (e.g. `x←1000 1000⍴⍳1000×1000`) should truncate but still allow editing
- [x] Tracer: bold the current line
- [ ] Tracer-specific status bar (show tracer keys when focused)
- [ ] Configurable tracer keys (currently hardcoded)

## Polish
- [ ] Symbol search rendering cleanup
- [ ] APLcart rendering cleanup (pink → standard gray)
- [ ] Consistent gray pane colors

## Phase 5: Dialogs
- [ ] OptionsDialog (yes/no/cancel prompts)
- [ ] StringDialog (text input)
- [ ] ReplyOptionsDialog/ReplyStringDialog

## Phase 6: APL Input - DONE
- [x] Backtick prefix for APL symbols (`` `a `` → `⍺`, `` `r `` → `⍴`, etc.)
- [x] Symbol search modal - search by name ("iota", "rho", "shape", "each")
- [x] APLcart modal - search idioms from aplcart.info

## Phase 7: Polish
- [ ] Syntax highlighting for APL
- [ ] Input history (beyond session - persist across runs?)
- [ ] Status bar (connection info, workspace name from UpdateSessionCaption)
- [ ] Better error display (HadError message handling)
- [ ] Highlight ⍝« commands in session output

## Future Ideas
- [ ] Multiline input improvements (RIDE does this poorly)
- [ ] Multiple workspace connections?

## Notes

### Session Behavior
The Dyalog session is append-only from the interpreter's perspective. Client shows editable history, but executing always appends:
1. User sees previous input `      1+1` with result `2`
2. User navigates up, edits to `      1+2`, executes
3. Original line resets to `      1+1`
4. New line `      1+2` appended, then result `3`

### Multiline Editing
RIDE handles multiline poorly. Research needed on:
- How interpreter expects multiline input
- What protocol messages are involved
- Opportunity to do better than RIDE

### RIDE Protocol Messages (Reference)

**Implemented:**
- Execute (→), AppendSessionOutput (←), SetPromptType (←)
- OpenWindow, UpdateWindow, CloseWindow, SaveChanges, ReplySaveChanges (editors)
- SetHighlightLine, WindowTypeChanged (tracer)
- SetLineAttributes (→) - breakpoints
- StepInto, RunCurrentLine, ContinueTrace, Continue, RestartThreads (→) - stepping
- TraceBackward, TraceForward (→) - trace navigation

**Not yet implemented:**
- OptionsDialog, StringDialog, Reply* (dialogs)
- HadError (error handling)
- GetAutoComplete, ReplyGetAutoComplete (autocomplete)

- [x] Empty line insertion for spacing

### Phase 2c: Floating Panes
- [x] Floating pane system (pane.go)
- [x] Cell-based compositor for rendering panes over session
- [x] Focus management with visual indicator (double border)
- [x] Mouse: click to focus, drag to move (edge resize partial - see Priority section)
- [x] Keyboard: Tab to cycle focus, Esc to close pane
- [x] Debug pane migrated to floating pane (scrollable)

### Phase 2d: Bubbles Integration & Testing
- [x] Upgraded to lipgloss v2, added bubbles
- [x] viewport.Model for debug pane scrolling
- [x] help.Model for keybindings display at bottom
- [x] key.Binding for all keybindings
- [x] cellbuf for pane compositing (replaces custom grid)
- [x] Go test framework (uitest/) - wraps tmux, HTML reports
- [x] Config loading from config.json
- [x] Key mappings pane (C-] ?)

### Phase 2e: Leader Key & Polish
- [x] Leader key system (Ctrl+]) - keeps all keys free for APL
- [x] Quit behind C-] q with y/n confirmation dialog
- [x] Ctrl+C shows vim-style "Type C-] q to quit" hint
- [x] Dyalog orange (#F2A74F) for all UI borders
- [x] ANSI-aware cellbuf compositor for styled panes
- [x] Input routing fix - focused panes consume all keys
- [x] Test reports with ANSI colors and clickable test→snapshot links
- [x] Config from config.default.json (no hardcoded Go defaults)
- [x] Debug pane real-time updates (LogBuffer survives Model copies)

### Phase 2f: Session Fixes
- [x] Input indentation preserved when sending to Dyalog (6-space APL indent)
- [x] External input display (only skip our own echo, show input from Dyalog terminal)

### Phase 4a: Tracer Stack & Debugging Infrastructure
- [x] Tracer stack management (single pane, not multiple overlapping windows)
- [x] Stack pane (C-] s toggle, shows all suspended frames)
- [x] Click/Enter in stack pane switches tracer view
- [x] Escape pops stack frame (sends CloseWindow)
- [x] CloseWindow timing fix (wait for ReplySaveChanges before closing)
- [x] Protocol logging (-log flag for RIDE messages and TUI actions)
- [x] Adaptive color detection (ANSI/ANSI256/TrueColor, exact #F2A74F when supported)

### Phase 4b: Tracer Controls & Breakpoints
- [x] Breakpoint toggle (C-] b) with visual indicator (●)
- [x] SetLineAttributes message for immediate breakpoint effect
- [x] Breakpoints saved with SaveChanges (Modified flag set)
- [x] Tracer mode read-only (blocks text insertion when Debugger=true)
- [x] Stepping: Enter/n=step over, i=into, o=out
- [x] Continue: c=continue, r=resume all
- [x] Navigation: p=backward, f=forward (skip)
- [x] Edit mode: e=enter edit, Esc=save & return to tracer
- [x] Title shows [tracer] vs [edit] mode

### Phase 4c: Connection Resilience & Window Management
- [x] GetWindowLayout on connect/reconnect (restores orphaned windows)
- [x] CloseAllWindows command (close-all-windows via command palette)
- [x] Command palette scrolling support
- [x] Protocol exploration tool (cmd/explore/)

### Phase 4d: Variables Pane
- [x] Variables pane (C-] l) - shows vars with values in tracer or session
- [x] Two modes: `[local]` (assigned in function) vs `[all]` (all visible)
- [x] `~` toggles between modes
- [x] Bullet markers (•) distinguish locals from outer-scope vars in [all] mode
- [x] Enter opens variable in editor
- [x] Async loading with "Loading..." indicator
- [x] `executeInternal` for silent queries (no session pollution)
- [x] Single APL query `{⎕←⍵,'=',⍕⍎⍵}¨↓⎕NL 2` avoids callback chaining issues
- [x] Parses function header for local declarations

### CLI & Scripting
- [x] Non-interactive mode: -e for single expression, -stdin for piping
- [x] Link support: -link path or -link ns:path runs ]link.create before executing
- [x] apl script: ephemeral Dyalog instance for one-shot execution
- [x] Auto-launch: -launch/-l starts Dyalog automatically (process group cleanup on exit)
- [x] Socket mode: -sock /path for Unix socket server (APL as a service)
  - Works: expressions, `⎕` input, workspace persistence across connections
  - Broken: `⍞` input (NONCE ERROR, root cause unknown - see adnotata/0008)

### Connection Resilience
- [x] Detect disconnection (EOF, connection reset) - show [disconnected] state with red border
- [x] Keep gritt alive when disconnected: session buffer, debug logs preserved
- [x] Allow reconnect (C-] r) without losing local state
- [x] `)off` intentional shutdown exits cleanly
- [x] External `)off` just disconnects (doesn't exit)
- [x] `⍝ Disconnected` marker in session output

### Config Robustness
- [x] Embedded default config (go:embed gritt.default.json)
- [x] Renamed config files to gritt.json (avoids conflicts)
- [x] Missing key bindings handled gracefully (disabled, not crash)

### Command Palette & Pane Control
- [x] Command palette (C-] :) - searchable command list
- [x] Pane move mode (C-] m) - arrows move, shift+arrows resize
- [x] Save session command (via command palette, prompts for filename)

### APL Input
- [x] Backtick prefix for APL symbols (`` `i `` → `⍳`, `` `r `` → `⍴`, etc.)
- [x] Symbol search (C-] : → symbols) - search by name
- [x] APLcart integration (C-] : → aplcart) - search 3000+ idioms
